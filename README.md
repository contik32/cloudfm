Cloud.fm audio player
There are a few ideas behind this software:
- Being able to play your own (or shared by your friends) MP3 live over internet
- Tracks are selected randomly from all collection
- Purely HTML5 (write code once, use it on any device with a browser)
- Using Bootstrap for responsiveness
- Single-page web app (avoid using any complex frameworks / patterns)
